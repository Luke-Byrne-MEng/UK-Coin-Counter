# UK-Coin-Counter
During this project an attempt was made to perform object detection and classification using OpenCV and python. The goal was to detect UK coins within images, and then classify them based on their value. For the sample set images the program acheived an average detection accuracy of 95.75%. (median 100%), and an average classification accuracy of 69.68% (median 71.11%). These results reinforce the general consensus that classical techniques are best suited for object detection within highly controlled or static environments, however machine learning techniques are often requred to perform accuracte classifcation.

This project was developed in Google Collab, as a Jupyter Notebook.

The image set used for development and testing is availble in this repo as coins.zip
